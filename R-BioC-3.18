#!/bin/bash
# This script runs a docker container
# (bioconductor/bioconductor_docker:RELEASE_3_18), maps local folders to
# folders accessible within the docker (using -v , e.g.
# -v /run/media:/run/media maps the folder /run/media on the host to a
# folder /host/run/media within docker - accessing this folder
# within the docker thus accesses the mapped folder on the host), and starts
# R passing all eventual passed parameters to it.
#
# Configurations for mapped folders needs to be adapted!
#
# Importantly, R packages will be installed into the (host) local folder
# mapped to /usr/local/lib/R/host-site-library within the docker. Thus,
# any R packages installed will also be avaiable when R is re-started.
#
# Also, R will be started in the present folder (through `pwd`).
#
# For definition of other parameters, such as --cpus, --memory, refer to the
# documentation of the docker command.

# Allow the docker to open X11 windows. Might need to be adapted/configures
# based on the host operating system and security settings.
xhost + local:docker
# Eventual alternative:
# HOSTNAME=`hostname`
# /usr/X11/bin/xhost + $HOSTNAME

# Run R in docker using R libraries defined in R_LIBS and mapping the home
# directory.
R_LIBS="/home/jo/R/docker/BioC-3.18"
# in which folder should R be started
